#+title: E Governance


* Unit 1 : Introduction to E-Governance and E-Government
** E-Government
- involves utilizing technology devices, such as computers and the internet, for faster means of delivering public services to citizens
- offer new opportunities for more direct and convenient citizen access to government and for government provision of services directly to citizen
*** Benefits
1. better provision of government services
2. ensure greater level of efficiency and effectiveness in government activities and operation
3. efficient government management
4. improve quality of public services
*** As a Information System
- design deals first with software then hardware
- fives stages
**** Project assessment
**** Analysis of current reality
**** Design of proposed system
**** System construction
**** Implementation and beyond
*** Life-cycle
** E-Governance
- eGovernance is the use of ICT in governing country/state or any organization.
- It is a functionality that uses ICT to enhance range and quality of information and services delivered to public in an effective manner.
*** Features
*** Models
*** Evolution
**** Policy framework
**** Enhanced public services
**** high quality and cost effective government operation
**** Citizen engagement in democratic process
**** Administrative and Institutional reforms
*** Scope
1. efficiency and effective executive functions
2. greater transparency
3. improve relation between citizen and state; improving democratic process
*** Content
1. hardware and corresponding system software
2. networking
3. application software along with DBMS
*** Service Delivery
** Online Service Delivery
** Electronic Service Delivery
** Present Global Trend
* Unit 2 : Models of E-Governance
 - use of ICT to provide quality information and services
 - efficient, cost-effective and convenient
** Models of Digital Governanace
*** Broadcasting Model
*** Critical Flow Model
*** Comparative Analysis Model
*** Mobilization and Lobbying Model
*** Interactive Service Model
** Maturity Model
*** Closed
*** Initialized
*** Planned
*** Realized
*** Institutionalized
** Toward Good Governance
* Unit 3 : E-Government Infrastructure Development
** Network Infrastructure
- hardware and software resource that enable network connectivity, communication, management and operation of entire network
- provide communication path and services between users, processes, application, services and internet
- entire architecture is interconnected and can be used for internal or external communication
*** Network Hardware
- routers
- switches
- LAN card
- cables
*** Network Software
- network operation and management
- operating system
- firewall
- network security application
*** Network Service
- T-1 line
- satellite
- wireless protocol
- IP address
** Computer Infrastructure
- foundation or framework that support the system
- provide management and support for servers, end-user, storage, operating system, database, middle-ware
- three groups
**** Database administration
**** End-user computing
**** Server and storage services
** Data Center
- centralized location where computing and networking equipment is concentrated for collecting, storing, distributing and processing data
- need
- component
- working mechanism
** E-government Architecture
- figure: architecture structure
*** Presentation layer
*** E-government layer
*** Business architecture layer
*** Information architecture layer
*** Technology architecture layer
** Interoperability Framework
- set of standard and guidelines for inter-organization interaction
- should be followed by public sector information system to achieve technical and operational interoperability
- three levels of interoperability
  1. organizational
  2. semantic
  3. technical
** Cloud Governance
- framework to govern the use of cloud services
- include people, process, technology while ensuring security, cost management, and deployment acceleration
- helps in regulating and controlling use of cloud services by defining process, standard and policies to be followed to operate cloud services
*** Key benefits
1. controlled access
2. reduced security risk
3. enhanced compliance readiness
4. lowered cost
*** Elements of Cloud Governance
** E-readiness
- degree to which a country's economy is ready, willing or prepared to integrate ICT
- ability to use power of ICT for development
*** Prerequisite
1. data system infrastructure preparedness
2. legal infrastructure preparedness
3. human infrastructure preparedness
4. institutional infrastructure preparedness
5. technology infrastructure preparedness
** Management Information System
- computing system that serve as a backbone of an organizational system
- gather, analyze and report data
- is a study of people, technology, organization and their relationship
* Unit 4 : Security in E-Government
** Challenges
- Information security is determined in terms of Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
** Approach
- cryptographic mechanism
- database design
- anti-virus system
- firewalls
- analysis tools
- monitoring tools
- biometric technology
** Security Management Approach
*** Access Control Model
*** Security Architecture Model
*** Biba Integration Model
*** Clark-Whitson Model
*** Graham-Denning Access Control Model
** E-Government Security Architecture
** Security Standard
* Unit 5 : Application of Datawarehousing and Data Mining in Government
** Introduction
- collection of tools and technique using which more knowledge can be obtained from large set of data
- helps in decision making and provide more information resource
- is basically a database with unique data structure that allows relatively quick and easy performance of complex queries
** Features of Data Warehouse
- subject oriented
- time variant
- integrated
- non volatile
** Advantage
- delivery enhanced business intelligence
- saves time
- enhances data quality and consistency
- generate high ROI
- strealine flow of information
** Data Mining
- refers to knowledge extraction from large amount of data
- data source = database, website, data warehouse
- computer-supported process of analyzing data
** Application of Data Mining
- healthcare
- education
- manufacturing
- fraud detection
- customer relation management
